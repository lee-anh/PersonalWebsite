            Here are some of my projects through the years. Most of my projects
            have been school projects but I recently have been working on more
            personal projects. To graduate early, I spread my junior year
            coursework over my sophomore and senior years which is why I've
            organized the sections like this. My favorite language is C++
            because the runtime is just so good :D

            During my fall semester, I took CS 420 Artificial Intelligence and
            CS 320 Database Management Systems. Here are a few of my projects
            from these classes, although there are 2 projects for Databases that
            were group projects and not displayed here.

            Hopefully you can see how much I've improved since freshman year!
            One challenge of my first year of college was that it was fully
            remote. However, I learned SO much. In the fall I took CS 150 Data
            Structures and Algorithms and in the spring I took CS 205 Software
            Engineering.
