            I am a senior at Lafayette College in Easton, PA. I'm completing a
            B.S. in Computer Science and a Math minor in 3 years, and I
            currently hold a 4.0/4.0 GPA. Prior to that, I graduated as
            valedictorian from Ashland High School in Massachusetts.
            <br /> <br />I always strive to do my best academically and really
            understand and engage with the course material. I genuinely enjoy
            studying and learning about how things work.
